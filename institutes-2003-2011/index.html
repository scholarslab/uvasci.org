        <h4>Institutes (2003-11)</h4>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>Reports and lists of participants from each of the Scholarly Communication Institutes are archived <a href="http://libra.virginia.edu/catalog/libra-oa:3260">here</a>. Descriptions of each institute are available below. </p>
          <h5>SCI 9 (2011) New-Model Scholarly Communication: Road Map for Change</h5>
          <p>SCI 9 focused on assessing new models of humanities publishing, creating a road map for catalyzing the most promising of them, and developing implementation strategies. The meeting brought together scholars, librarians, publishers, higher education administrators, and funders noted for their innovative approaches to scholarly communication. </p>
          <h5>SCI 8 (2010) Experimental Approaches to New-Model Scholarly Communication</h5>
          <p>SCI 8 focused on exploring forms of publication that take advantage of new affordances of digital technologies, both for research and for representing knowledge. The meeting gathered scholars experimenting with new venues for the dissemination and assessment of scholarship online. The goal of this Institute was to identify the publishing needs of such scholars and to articulate the new forms of scholarly publishing beyond digital versions of analog monographs and journals suitable for their work. Though we did not focus on issues of validating and credentialing per se, we addressed them as appropriate, understanding that publishers rely on a community of expert scholars to determine what scholarship merits publication. </p>
          <h5>SCI 7 (2009) Spatial Technologies and Methodologies</h5>
          <p>SCI 7 focused on <em>spatial technologies and methodologies</em>—the specific modes of working they favor, the scholarly practices they enhance, and the infrastructure they demand to achieve scale and significance. Also considered were visualizations such as virtual modeling and concept mapping, as appropriate. SCI 7 brought together accomplished scholars from the humanities and social sciences, as well as leaders in information technology and data stewardship, to explore the range of these technologies and their promise to advance humanities scholarship. </p>
          <h5>SCI 6 (2008) Humanities Research Centers</h5>
          <p>SCI 6 assembled a group of recognized scholars and pioneers in digital scholarship, leaders in the humanities, and program officers from funding agencies interested in advancing digital scholarship through a reflection upon experiences of the broader scholarly community, the evolution of humanities scholarship, and examples of ‘national models for centers of excellence. </p>
          <h5>SCI 5 (2007) Visual Studies</h5>
          <p>Visual media, i.e. motion pictures, photography, video, 3-D images, simulations, and new media artworks, are having profound effects on scholarship. SCI 5 brought together several accomplished scholars from the humanities and sciences, including both theorists and practitioners, focusing primarily on visual scholars, those who utilize the visual in all facets of scholarly communication, from research and analysis to communicating their scholarship to others. </p>
          <h5>SCI 4 (2006) Architectural History</h5>
          <p>SCI 4 2006 focused on the discipline of architectural history. Participants explored the promises of new information technologies to represent more accurately the visual and spatial domains of the built environment. </p>
          <h5>SCI 3 (2005) Digital Humanities</h5>
          <p>The third SCI in 2005 focused on those who had extensive digital experience in the humanities and attempted to address the challenge of sustainability by developing institutional strategies that would support on-going digital scholarship.</p>
          <h5>SCI 2 (2004) Practical Ethics</h5>
          <p>The second SCI, held at the University of Virginia in 2004, convened institutional teams (senior scholars, junior scholar/graduate student, University administrator and librarian) to focus on opportunities for innovation in digital scholarship in a specific field: Practical Ethics. </p>
          <h5>SCI 1 (2003) Goals and Strategies</h5>
          <p>The first three Scholarly Communication Institutes (SCI), 2003-2005, were designed to explore opportunities for advancing innovation in digital scholarly communication and to catalyze digital scholarship and start to build the core infrastructure to support it in the arts and humanities. </p>
